#   I have worked in Web Support for large scale sites with F5 Networks, working to resolve and implement requests and issues related to its many internal and external sites. Managing requests from various parts of the company, I would resolve issues, create pages and mini-sites, updating pages with valid markup and applying new updated designs and styles that adhere to current web standards.

# I also have experience with freelance web design, designing and building websites for Sesame Communications, as well as numerous other websites, both personal and professional.

# I am skilled with HTML/CSS and knowledgeable of web standards. While higher development isn't my strong point, I can read and work well with JavaScript, PHP, and databases, and have worked with different content management, wiki and blogging systems, adjusting them to fit a site's needs.
